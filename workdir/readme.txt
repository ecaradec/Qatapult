# Tips
- The default hotkey is SHIFT+SPACE
- A few options are in the top right corner of the default skin
- A lot of other possibilities are discussed on the DonationCoder forum http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?board=308.0 

# How to send emails from blat
Qatapult uses blat to send email. Currently you must set your email, username and password inside the settings.xml file directly.
Blat also doesn't work natively with gmail so if you use gmail or another ssl secure email provider use the following tutorial
http://www.jeffkastner.com/2010/01/blat-stunnel-and-gmail/ to configure blat.

# How to add new personal rules
Rules are defined into settings.xml. There are already a few defined that you can use for inspiration. Qatapult usually 
will use a series of types and keywords with an action that fetch the various information from the selected panes on match.
